I'm a graduate student at Florida Polytechnic University studying Industrial Engineering (Engineering Management), and I'll be an alum soon. Due to Industry 4.0 technologies (fourth generation) such as robotics, cryptocurrencies, AI, Digital Twins, and driverless vehicles, the scope of industrial engineering has been interwoven with Big Data Analytics (not just analysis!) for the past decade.
Here, I'll be able to enhance and better understand coding (programming language) skills.


- Iâ€™m currently working on my "Data Visualization" skills for professional and high level presentation. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning **R** language programming.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on newable and clean energies.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no idea but am very curious about the generation after Gen Z!
